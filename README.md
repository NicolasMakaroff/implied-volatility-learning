# implied-volatility-learning
Finding new ways to find the implied volatilty using machine/deep learning methods.


To create the data base use the file create-uniform-database or use directly the database csv `implied-volatility.csv` file.
The classical **COS** methods (B&S, Brent, Heston) are in the file `Newton - Brent.ipynb`.

In the `DNN_implied_volatility.ipynb` is the implementation of the Dense Neural Network following the specification of the paper. Variants have been tested with no better results.

In the `ML-implied-volatility.ipynd` is other Machine Learning implementation.
